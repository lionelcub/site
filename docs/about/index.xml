      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Lionel, nice to meet you.  --  Data Analyst / Inquisitive / Problem Solver / Pragmatic / Organised
I have keen interests in creative, cognitive, and quantitative challenges. As an analyst, I often curious and question about various subjects, processes, and outcomes. I understand the significance of practicality. Advising a well-defined action is just as important as insight mining. I&amp;rsquo;m an organised person. I track my studies and activities to keep my productivity and routine in check with scrum and other methods.</description>
