      <description>Investigating Complaint Against Cold Storage Milk Products. Project purpose. In Mar 2018, Cold Storage started getting complaints from their clients that they have been getting complaints from end consumers of the dairy products going sour and often smelling. On getting these complaints, the supervisor pulls out data of the last 35 days’ temperatures.
