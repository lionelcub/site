      <description>Researching User Preference On Note-taking Apps. Project purpose. The user research team conducted an experiment design to find out whether users use built-in-app or third-party-app more often for note-taking. There are 20 users. Each user were asked to use both built-in-app and third-party-app on either iPhone or Andriod in different order. The users were randomly assigned to specifc order and device. Meaning, some users will use built-in-app first, while others will use third-app-party first, however, each users will use one device only.</description>
